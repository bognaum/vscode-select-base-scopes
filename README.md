# Select base scopes

This extension recognizes the base scopes of any language, like:
- strings,
- brackets,
- comments,
- regular expressions
- ect.

In most languages, these scopes have the same syntax. Therefore, the expansion determines them by the same syntactic rules. But for some individual languages, the rules may be special.
